# Expresso
This app has Recylerview displaying coffee Images, and description. And then each view (of main activity) is clickable and can have its own activity.
I have also used SQLiteDatabase to save the orders from all activities and keep their information in the orderSummary. So no matter you exit the app or the exit and choose to order different drink. Your previous order info will remain unless you clear the databse. The main Highlight of this App is the CART AND ITS ABILITY to hold the data.
